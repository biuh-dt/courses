Learning outcomes/competences

•	The students explain the history and basics of machine learning and establish the relationship to its practical applications.\
•	They master the use of common dimension reduction and feature selection methods in practical applications.\
•	They classify data using classification methods from statistical learning theory (such as support vector machines) and the field of artificial neural networks.\
•	They also use decision trees or discriminant analysis for this purpose.\
•	They use artificial neural networks to learn mappings between arbitrary input and output data (also for time series).\
•	They know different methods for parameter determination in artificial neural networks and use them in a targeted manner.\
•	They explain evolutionary algorithms and apply them.\
•	They have a comprehensive overview of machine learning methods and can assess which methods should be used in which application scenarios.\
•	They develop workflows for machine learning.

DT Academic Honesty Policy
The DT Department believes that personal honesty and integrity are as important in the computer field as technical skill. We want our degrees and certificates to reflect this belief. To help students understand what constitutes dishonesty in a DT course, we have developed a student academic dishonesty policy that includes, but is not limited to:

1.	Dishonest use of course materials, such as student papers, examinations, reports, and material posted on the Internet.
2.	Knowingly posting course materials of any kind on Internet sites such as (but not limited to) Course Hero and Chegg without the consent of the instructor.
3.	Knowingly assisting others in the dishonest use of course materials such as student papers, examinations, and reports.
4.	Knowingly providing course materials such as papers, lab data, reports, and/or electronic files to be used by another student as that student’s own work.
5.	Plagiarizing, i.e., using language or ideas from materials without acknowledgement and/or copying work from other sources and submitting it as one’s own.
6.	Examples of plagiarism include, but are not limited to:
•	Copying a phrase, a sentence, or a longer passage from a source (including an Internet source) and submitting it as one’s own.
•	Summarizing or paraphrasing someone else’s ideas without acknowledging the source.
•	Submitting group assignments individually as one’s independent work.
•	Copying or taking pictures of course materials such as videos, exams, quizzes, or assignments and posting the copied items and/or photos on the Internet or sharing these copied items and/or images with other students who have not yet completed the assignments.
•	Taking pictures or copying course materials that are considered confidential by the instructor, such as exams or quizzes.
7.	A student should complete all assignments and projects individually unless the instructor permits working with a partner or a group. 
8.	If the instructor requests the source files, online meeting, or data files used to produce the output, a student should comply, for example, by submitting evidence that contains his/her work.
9.	A student must not knowingly assist another student in the dishonest use of course materials.
10.	A student must not copy material from the Internet, books, magazines, newspapers, or any other source without acknowledgment. 
Disciplinary action for cheating will fail the course, and a formal report will be filed with the DT department. The student(s) will have the opportunity to meet with the DT department and/or appear before a Judicial Review Board to contest this report. Suspension, expulsion, or a record of the event on the student's transcript may result.
Withdrawal Policy
Course Withdrawals 
After the last day to withdraw, students may file a Petition for Late Withdrawal through the Registration Office.  Petitions for Late Withdrawal will be granted for extenuating circumstances only, including student illness, death in the immediate family, family emergencies, call to active duty, or other appropriate extenuating circumstances.  The student will be required to provide appropriate documentation for all requests for Late Withdrawal.  Prior to withdrawing from this class, students are encouraged to speak with the instructor.

Medical Withdrawals
If you wish to explore the possibility of withdrawing from the course for medical reasons, you must contact the Registration Office before the end of the semester. Verification from a physician or medical institution is typically required. 

Administrative Withdrawals
At the discretion of the Instructor, students not actively pursuing the completion of course objectives may be withdrawn from the class by the Instructor any time up to two weeks before the end of the term and given a grade of 'W.' 
Incomplete Policy 
To request an incomplete grade, you must obtain permission from the instructor, satisfy minimum completion requirements (see below), and sign an Incomplete contract by the Deadline Date set forth above under Important Dates. A minimum amount of completed work will be required to request an Incomplete grade. Contact the instructor if you are interested in receiving an Incomplete grade. 

An "I" grade will be given only when ALL of the following conditions are met: 
1.	The student must sign an Incomplete contract on or before the Deadline Date. No Incomplete grade can be given until the student signs the Incomplete contract. The contract will indicate the work to be completed and the completion date.

3.	The student must be working at a "C" level or higher. 
All incomplete work must be completed by the contracted date, which is usually around mid-term of the following term. It is the student's responsibility to watch this date carefully. No extensions beyond this date will be given. If you do not complete the remaining units by the deadline date specified in the Incomplete contract, then you will receive an F.
No extensions beyond the original Incomplete deadline date will be given. Students should be aware that an “I” grade left on a transcript may be interpreted by other colleges as an F. It may also affect other aspects of a student's college experience, such as financial aid.

Satisfactory/Fail (S/F) Grade Option\
The S/F grade option is not recommended to students in this course.\
Your assigned student email account will be used for all official communications from your instructor.
