Learning outcomes/competences

•	The students explain the history and basics of machine learning and establish the relationship to its practical applications.
•	They master the use of common dimension reduction and feature selection methods in practical application.
•	They classify data using classification methods from statistical learning theory (such as support vector machines) and from the field of artificial neural networks. They also use decision trees or discriminant analysis for this purpose.
•	They use artificial neural networks to learn mappings between arbitrary input and output data (also for time series).
•	They know different methods for parameter determination in artificial neural networks and use them in a targeted manner.
•	They explain evolutionary algorithms and apply them.
•	They have a comprehensive overview of machine learning methods and can assess which methods should be used in which application scenarios.
•	They develop workflows for machine learning.
